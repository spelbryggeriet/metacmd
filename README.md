# Meta Command

`metacmd` is a library which provides useful abstractions for command execution over different environments. Its goal is to make it simpler to construct and run commands within your programs, whether it is a local command (macOS, Windows, Linux, etc.), a remote command (SSH2) or a container command (Docker).
